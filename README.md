# Pong
  by Neelay Junnarkar
  
A Pong program I wrote during classes.
This program was written on a TI-89 using TI Basic.

Note: The variable c on line 18 is supposed to be bound to a block character that is available on the TI-89 by going into Char -> Special. The block may have been U+25FC, â—¼.
